# mgpxe - KoRo Frontend Assigment

Find your favorite images instantaneously  with mgpxe



For this project, I spent approximately 3-4 hours building a web app using React and Styled Components. The app connects to the Unsplash API and displays a list of random images to the user upon initial load. The user can then search for a specific keyword or phrase, and the app will display only images related to that keyword or phrase.

I encountered a few difficulties while working on this assignment. One of the main challenges I faced was related to the Unsplash API. I exceeded the hourly request limit a few times, which caused some delays in my testing process as I had to wait for the limit to reset. Despite this, I was able to troubleshoot the issue and complete the assignment.

In addition to the core functionality described above, I also created the logo for the app. I took care to ensure that the logo is original and free of any copyright issues.

I hope you find my submission satisfactory and I look forward to discussing the opportunity further. Thank you for considering my application.
